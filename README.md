# News & Weather App

A React-based dashboard that aggregates real-time news, weather, and market updates. It features a "Smart Mix" news engine that prioritizes high-impact stories and provides a focused, segment-based daily overview.

## Features

*   **Smart News Aggregation:** Fetches and ranks news from multiple high-quality RSS feeds (NDTV, The Hindu, BBC, etc.).
*   **Time-Segmented Experience:** UI adapts based on the time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night).
*   **Weather Updates:** Real-time weather for configured cities (Chennai, Trichy, Muscat).
*   **Market Data:** Live updates for BSE/NSE (configurable).
*   **Deep Customization:** Settings page to toggle sources, cities, and sections.
*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.

## Daily Brief Automation (E-Paper)

The "Daily Brief" tab is powered by a Python script that runs automatically via GitHub Actions.

### Features
*   **Daily Schedule:** Runs every morning at 6:30 AM IST (01:00 UTC).
*   **Sources:** Aggregates content from The Hindu, Indian Express, Dinamani, and Daily Thanthi.
*   **AI Summarization:** Uses Google Gemini 1.5 Flash to generate concise summaries for each section.

### Configuration
To enable the AI summarization feature, you must add your Google Gemini API key to the GitHub repository secrets.

1.  Go to your GitHub Repository -> **Settings** -> **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions**.
2.  Click **"New repository secret"**.
3.  **Name:** `GEMINI_API_KEY`
4.  **Value:** Your Google Gemini API Key (get it from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)).

If the key is missing, the automation will still fetch news articles but will skip the summarization step.

### Local Development
To run the aggregation script locally:
1.  Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  Set the environment variable (optional):
    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```bash
    python scripts/daily_brief.py
    ```

## Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18+ recommended)
*   npm

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-weather-app.git
    cd news-weather-app
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Configure Environment Variables:
    *   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
    *   Fill in your API keys (optional for basic RSS functionality, required for some direct APIs).
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4.  Start the Development Server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## API Configuration

The app uses a hybrid approach:
1.  **RSS Feeds (Primary):** Proxied via `rss2json` to avoid CORS. No key required for basic usage.
2.  **Weather:** Uses Open-Meteo (Free, no key) or other configured providers.
3.  **NewsData.io (Optional):** Can be used as a premium fallback if configured.

## Project Structure

*   `src/components`: Reusable UI components (WeatherCard, NewsSection, etc.).
*   `src/services`: API logic and data fetching (rssAggregator, weatherService).
*   `src/pages`: Main application views.
*   `src/context`: React Context for global state management.
*   `src/utils`: Helper functions.

## Contributing

1.  Fork the repo.
2.  Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`).
3.  Commit your changes.
4.  Push to the branch.
5.  Open a Pull Request.

## Install as App (PWA)

This application is a Progressive Web App (PWA), meaning you can install it on your device for a native-like experience (offline access, full screen, home screen icon).

### Android (Chrome)
1. Open the app in Chrome.
2. Tap the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top-right corner.
3. Tap **"Add to Home screen"** or **"Install App"**.
4. Follow the prompt to install.

### iOS (Safari)
1. Open the app in Safari.
2. Tap the **Share** button (square with arrow) at the bottom.
3. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**.
4. Tap **"Add"** in the top-right corner.

### Desktop (Chrome/Edge)
1. Look for the install icon (usually a computer with a down arrow) in the right side of the address bar.
2. Click it and select **"Install"**.

## Deployment Troubleshooting 🚨

**The app is deployed automatically to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions from the `main` branch.**

### Required Configuration
1.  Go to your GitHub Repository -> **Settings** -> **Pages**.
2.  Set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3.  The workflow `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will automatically build and deploy the app whenever you push to the `main` branch.

*Wait a couple of minutes after the next push for the site to build and update.*

**Note:** The compiled assets are not stored in the repository. The GitHub Action handles the build process entirely.
